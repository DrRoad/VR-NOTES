### 2025 AR/VR CONVERGENCE
By 2025 the distinctions between AR and VR will be insignificant; the devices will converge and be multifunctional. Their vast capabilities to blend natural and synthetic vision will cause us to rethink everything—from the social norms of human interaction to how private and public spaces are designed and navigated. New sports will inevitably emerge that will be designed to test athletes’ performance across the spectrum of mixed reality.

>• Headsets and AR glasses are still selling at peak smartphone numbers—150 million per quarter—because each year, the devices improve so rapidly.

>• Humans won’t need prescription glasses anymore. The AR system corrects vision for you, tracking your eye movement and focal point.

>• Batteries made from graphene rather than lithium ion don’t just double the capacity, they recharge in seconds.
>• Photons replace electrons as 3D photonic nanocrystals are integrated.

>• Hello, 8K video! You’ll have pure 20/20 vision of everything rendered.

>• AR and VR converge, as new glasses can bring on darkness by canceling light waves, much like noise-canceling headphones do.

>• In 2025, we’ll wear “smart contact lenses” that will gradually evolve to full AR functionality.

sphere-collider :
It emits events when objects collide. Those events are received by the `grab` component. For the official aframe tracked controllers demo, where you can grab blocks, there's an `aabb-collider` component, and it's the same basic idea.  
Neither is very precise, just using bounding spheres or boxes for performance

demo: https://sandbox.donmccurdy.com/vr/vive/
The red grid is coming from physics, there's a physics debug option.
But under the hood it's THREE.js's wireframe material.

aframe debug-ui
https://github.com/dmarcos/debug-ui
It's a simple way to achieve what dat.gui would do.
it hooks up component properties to the vive touchpad.
you can iterate over the properties using the grip button.
and adjust moving your thumb up and down the touchpad.
It's easier and even batter than having a visual slider on screen.
that can get in the way when modifying values and seeing the result immediately.

# MISC NOTES

## Difference between A-Frame React and React VR:

https://github.com/facebookincubator/react-vr/issues/18

• React VR apps are written in JavaScript, with JSX tags that are transpiled into JS. A-Frame apps use HTML, with custom HTML tags (whether this is advantage or disadvantage depends if you want to code in JS or HTML :) although A-Frame components are built with JavaScript.
• React VR is based on the React core (in production use since 2011, open sourced in 2013) and A-Frame is written from scratch (mid-to-late 2015). So contributing back to a-frame is not possible since they have different underlying implementations.
• React VR is build on top of React Native, with a JS runtime for WebVR, while aframe-react is a very thin layer on top of A-Frame to bridge with React JS.

• To add, having access to flexbox based layout within React VR shouldn't be underestimated when defining dynamic or UIs that need that little bit of iteration to get right. Layout is often forgotten but very important.
