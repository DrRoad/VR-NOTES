###2025 AR/VR CONVERGENCE
By 2025 the distinctions between AR and VR will be insignificant; the devices will converge and be multifunctional. Their vast capabilities to blend natural and synthetic vision will cause us to rethink everything—from the social norms of human interaction to how private and public spaces are designed and navigated. New sports will inevitably emerge that will be designed to test athletes’ performance across the spectrum of mixed reality.

• Headsets and AR glasses are still selling at peak smartphone numbers—150 million per quarter—because each year, the devices improve so rapidly.
• Humans won’t need prescription glasses anymore. The AR system corrects vision for you, tracking your eye movement and focal point.
• Batteries made from graphene rather than lithium ion don’t just double the capacity, they recharge in seconds.
• Photons replace electrons as 3D photonic nanocrystals are integrated.
• Hello, 8K video! You’ll have pure 20/20 vision of everything rendered.
• AR and VR converge, as new glasses can bring on darkness by canceling light waves, much like noise-canceling headphones do.
• In 2025, we’ll wear “smart contact lenses” that will gradually evolve to full AR functionality.
